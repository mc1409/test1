"During building our own data science models we learned that getting external data is tedious, unreliable and often low quality and at the same time you have to work with hundreds of providers to get what you actually need. Our new product Sharcx.datasets is solving that problem for you. Let us do the tedious work and you can focus on data science." Philip Roeder, COO
